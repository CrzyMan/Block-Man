BLOCK MAN
=========

This is just a spin-off of the calculator game "Block Dude." <br><br>
Developed by CrzyMan <br>
using HTML5, Javascript

----
TO PREVIEW

Simply run "main.html" (or the other main.html!) in a canvas element supporting browser to get a working model of the final level of "Block Dude." (currently the last level of Block Dude, but level two of Block Man)

----
IMPLEMENTED:
- Accurate to original game movement and physics
- Actual Levels (first and last)
- Differentiation of different kinds of blocks (brick, movable, player, door... and technically air)
- Incorporation of Vector objects.
- Request based movement (a.k.a. occupation intents) to reduce superfluous code.
- Level Win recognition.
- Switch level after win.
- Level data compression/decompression.
- only 1 level decompressed at a time (save on memory).
- All real Block Dude Levels
- Can explore laterally

TO BE DONE:

- Explore map without moving the player (shift+arrow).
- Passwords.
- Level menu.
- Reset Level (r).
- Main menu.

FUTURE PLANS:

- Make a 3D first/third person version of the game.
