TO PREVIEW

Simply run "main.html" in a canvas element supporting browser to get a working model of the final level of "Block Dude."

IMPLEMENTED:
- Accurate to original game movement and physics
- Actual Levels (first and last)
- Different Colors for different kinds of blocks (brick, movable, player, door... and technically air)

IN PROGRRESS:
- Request based movement (a.k.a. occupation intents). <br>
  This should greatly reduce the amount of code and calculations.
- Level Win recognition.
- Switch level after win (tbd after level win recognition).
